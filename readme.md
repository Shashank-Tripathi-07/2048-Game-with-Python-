*Hello* 

This is my version of the 2048 game. It's built using Data structures and I've explained everything extensively in the code. 

**HOW TO RUN THIS** 

All you need is to fork this repo or copy the code to VS Code and then, click on run and this game starts working in the VS Code terminal. 

***ENJOY***
